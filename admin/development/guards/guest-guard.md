# Guest Guard

A **Guest Guard** restricts access to certain pages for authenticated users, redirecting them away from areas like login or signup if theyâ€™re already logged in. Ideal for enhancing user flow and preventing redundant actions.\
\
**Guest guard** is configured at **`src/utils/route-guard/GuestGuard.tsx`**\
\
We have used it the same as follows:

```typescript
<GuestGuard>
      <AuthLayout>{children}</AuthLayout>
</GuestGuard>
```
