# Motivation

**There are plenty of UI Kits and admin templates in the market but what makes** [**SaasAble**](https://blog.saasable.io/say-hello-to-saasable-the-ultimate-ui-kit-for-web-app-development) **different than others?**&#x20;

The main things that make SaasAble are _design motivation_ and _easy-to-use components_. SaasAble is designed using Google's latest Material Design 3 specifications which you can refer to [here](https://m3.material.io/).

SaasAble is a blended part of Material Design 3. With [10 years of experience](https://blog.saasable.io/a-decade-of-expertise-the-phoenixcoded-story-and-why-you-should-trust-us) in design, we prepare our design components to help users. You will find that component designs are heavily inspired by new and latest design trends that enable you to keep your site current.
