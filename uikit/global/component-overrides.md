# Component overrides

SaasAble offers multiple theme options, each with its individual component overrides. These overridden components are specifically designed to match the selected theme and will be applied to the entire project based on the chosen theme.

All these overrides can be found under `src/views/landings/{theme name}/theme/overrides` where the **{theme name}** can be: **ai, crm, default** etc.

Following is an example of a `AI` theme button override:
